# Logging Roads

This is a fork of the [OSM logging roads](loggingroads.org) project to demonstrate possible points of integration between the HOT Tasking Manager and the public microsite.  The current *(as of October 2015)* public version swaps out the Tasking Manager in favor of [To Fix](https://github.com/crowdcover/to-fix).

### Development

`bundle exec jekyll serve -w --baseurl ''`
